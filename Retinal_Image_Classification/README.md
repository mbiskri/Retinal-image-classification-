# Retinal Image Classification Project

## Description

This project focuses on classifying retinal images into categories using advanced deep learning techniques.
The goal is to identify various retinal conditions with high accuracy by leveraging ensemble models and balanced data processing methods.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of retinal images divided into multiple categories. 
Due to size constraints, the dataset is hosted externally. You can download it from [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zkfo6tzkBDNRNsoo8OLnqOZJQw7Clmlh?usp=drive_link/https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/kermany2018].

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are required to run this project:

```
tensorflow
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

## Methodology

- **Data Balancing:** Techniques such as oversampling and undersampling were used to handle class imbalance.
- **Modeling:** Leveraged transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet50.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combined predictions from multiple models to improve classification accuracy.
- **Evaluation:** Used metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices to evaluate performance.
